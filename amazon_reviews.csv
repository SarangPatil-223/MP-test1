No.,Review
1,"Connectivity is good , battery life is excellent , sound quality is good according to the price of the product according to price it is worth it, ear cups are decent , you may found it uncomfortable to wear at first but you not feel it after long use , you cannot use it for long hours make sure to take breaks , it doesnt absorb sweat so you may feel sweaty after long use , connectivity is fast, mic quality is good in silent places but may not in crowdy places especially for call.

So conclusion is it is a good headphone in this price range."
2,"(at the end I have updated to my latest experience) So I ordered it coz it has too many features and also a trust on this brand, but I am still using in the early phase so I'll share my pov:

PROS:
-Used around 3 days it came full charge and still has 80% battery (listening high quality music at 50-70% and gaming on gaming mode (will talk about gaming too wait!) so it will last around more than 7-8 days easily :) at 60% but haven't tested it completely will update soon :)

-plastic and durability is like 3.8 or 4 out of 5 they used hard plastic so that's good also the comfort is good it has soft cushions and also appearance of the headphone is really really good go for black or biege option!

- Sound quality is like 8/10 it has really good base! The vocals are clear if you increase your volume to 50% + but it does have a con will share in a moment

- if you are under 20 age with small to medium head then it is suitable for you :)

- yes the SD card works very well just make sure your SD card is clean and only has .mp3 files.

-Gamers you can go for it if you don't play sports! Then go for it, Emin gaming mode it has very minimal latency which unfortunately I can't count but yeah I play a lot of games so it is working very well, you can play in 80% volume no leakage :) depends on the game also! The aux cable and gaming mode both works equally same and is really good :)

- Voice call quality is 8/10 :)

CONS:
-if you have bigger head don't buy it, it will fit your head easily but then the cushions will start hurting in 3-4 hours so yeah like I have medium to bigger head so it hurts a bit after some hours

-Cushions doesn't absorb any sweat!

- it has sound leakage issue so basically above 60% or above 50% the sound comes out! Well it depends on what you are listening if it's phonk then stay low at 40-50% trust me it still sounds good! If you are listening to simple lofi songs then go for 60% + so yeah!

- the ENC is a joke here üòÇ

- in gaming the sounds of gunshots are a bit too loud so yeah

So yeah a 4 day review and yes it is worth it and value for money product also a year warranty is also there haha!

Will update after some weeks of usage :)

Edit : so after months of usage it's still like when I bought ‚ù§Ô∏è perfect durable looks are still good also the sound quality at this price range is perfect also every method works and connectivity is fast, for me using everyday 3-6 hrs works easily for 10 days! You don't even need to turn on gaming mode coz the normal mode is just so good! Barely any latency, the enc is clickbait I don't think it works but honestly for me when I wear it and play music or meeting calls and other multimedia at at least 50-60 volume : I can't hear noise at all barely audible so that's good! Overall gor for it!"
3,"I brought it for 999 rupee...
Pros : good design üëç
Looks premium
Sound quality ok for this price
Battery will easily last 3-4 days on normal
Use and 2 days on extreme heavy usage
Good connectivity, haven't had any issues.
during connecting this device.
Cons : it has gaming mode and music mode which can be changed by holding power button for 2 second. But I have faced issues in gaming mode, when I was listening music in gaming mode the music was laggy .... But if played on music mode it does its job
Another thing I didn't like is the build quality, even though it's pretty good there are gaps between the cushion and headphones, I can see the battery inside.... And if water gets into that it might get damaged soo yeah.....
Btw forgot to mention about mic. It's pretty good it's does its job

Overall would recommend and will update if anything happens to my headphones"
4,Its not durable enough to endure it for 2 months. Cushion cover ended up falling within 2 months but the sound quality is good. Size is fit. The weight is good too. But the mic quality is really bad please improve it.
5,"I got this headphone for ‚Çπ749 and i have to say that it doesn't feel like a 749 rupees headphone.

Pros:-
The bass is adequate, audio is also clear and the battery backup is excellent. I am using this for the last 6 -7 hour at 50% volume and the charge is still showing 100%, the charge indicater changes from 100-90-70-50 and so on. Build quality is also good for the price as everyone else who uses this will tell that this is a 1500 rupees headphone. The connectivity is fine and the range is also very good,it gives no problem even you are 20 feet away from your phone. The cushions are fine for the price,but your ears might sweat during summers

Cons:-
Don't expect the mic to work like a charm because it captures external noise too much and your voice won't be very clear on a call.
The gaming mode is nonsense,just use the provided aux cable if you want to play games.

Overall if you want to buy this for battery backup and listening to music under budget,just go for it üòâ

Amazon was suggesting to write about portability and service, I don't think that y'all will care to repair it if damaged because it's so affordable,just buy a new one and yeah it's portable enough but the ear covers don't rotate to you might face some difficulty"
6,Very hard base but sound leak up to 50 percentage

9,"I got 799 this product.it is good quality of product, battery backup upto 20 hours, easily replacement 1year waranty card available . Easily to connect the device.compatibility is high and also sound clarity."
10,"The reason for 3 stars is that the build quality is not very good, and also one of the cushions came off. Talking about sound and baas is very good for that i will give 5 stars, battery backup is super."
